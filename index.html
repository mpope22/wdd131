            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Me and my wife have been married for a little over a year now, we have one sweet baby girl and our dog hank to round out our family. We live in Utah surrounded by family which has been the greatest blessing I've ever known. I am currently working full time as an auto glass technician while I go to school to support my family at this time as well.</p>

            <p>Utah is a wonderful place. I was born and raised here and given the time my children will grow up here as well. In Utah there are all kinds of climates and activities for all comers. For those who love the cold, the mountains to the North have great ski and snowboard resorts. For those who prefer warmer weather, the south is rich with great hiking and views of the bright red rocks. There are even some great lakes to go fishing or do water sports. There is something for everyone.</p>
